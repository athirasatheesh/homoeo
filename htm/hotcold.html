<p class="p1"><b>SOME CASES TO SHOW THE METHOD OF WORKING</b></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><b>CASE I</b></p>
<p class="p3"><i>     </i>Miss B., æt. 52. Been heavy tea drinker for twenty years ; had much pain and discomfort in stomach ; with flatulence immediately after eating ; gradually got better till next meal ; much rumbling in abdomen. Appetite poor ; bowels fairly regular.</p>
<p class="p3">Desires - Salt, sweets.</p>
<p class="p3">Averse - Fats, acids.</p>
<p class="p3">Flushes of heat with sweating which relieved her.</p>
<p class="p3">She was very thin ; excitable person - a bundle of nerves.</p>
<p class="p3">On further enquiry she was found to be very chilly.</p>
<p class="p3">GENERALS</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Very Chilly. &lt; </i>Spring. &lt; Before and during thunder-storm.</p>
<p class="p3">Irritable in morning.</p>
<p class="p3">Anxiety for others.</p>
<p class="p3">Fears, Burglars ; something going to happen ; crowds ; being suffocated, and therefore in tunnel.</p>
<p class="p3">Impatient.</p>
<p class="p3">Suspicious.</p>
<p class="p3">Very sensitive ; readily offended ; startled easily with least noise.</p>
<p class="p3">CHILLY PATIENT - Used as Eliminating Symptom : only chilly remedies are given in the following lists.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Fears : </i>Something will happen (Kent's Repertory : p. 45). - Alum., <i>Ars., Calc., Carb-v., </i>CAUST., Graph., <i>Kali-ars., </i>Kali-p., Mag-c., Mang., Nat-a., PHOS.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Fears : </i>suffocation (p. 47) - Carb-an., <i>Phos., Stram..</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>Fears : </i>crowd (p. 43) - Aloe, Ars., Bar-c., Calc., Carb-an., Caust., Con., Ferr., Graph., Hep., <i>Kali-ar., </i>K-bi., Kali-c., Kali-p., Nat-a., Nat-c., <i>Nux-v., </i>Phos., Plb., Rhus-t., Stann.</p>
<p class="p3">Anxiety for others (p. 7) - <i>Ars., </i>Bar-c., Cocc., Phos.</p>
<p class="p3">Suspicious (p. 85) - ARS., <i>Aur., </i>BAR-C., <i>Bar-m., Bell., Bor., Calc-p., Carb-s., </i>Canth., CAUST., Cham., Chin., <i>Cimic., Cocc., </i>Con., Graph., <i>Hyos., </i>KALI-ARS., <i>Kali-p., </i>Mur-ac., <i>Nat-a., Nat-c., Nit-ac., </i>Nux-v., <i>Phos., Plb., </i>RHUS-T., Ruta, <i>Sep., </i>Sil., Stann., Staph., STRAM., <i>Sul-ac., </i>Viol-t.</p>
<p class="p3">Offended readily (p. 69) - Agar., <i>Alum., Ars., Aur., </i>Bor., <i>Calc., </i>Camph., <i>Caps., </i>Carb-s., <i>Carb-v., Caust., </i>Cham., Chel., Chin., Chin-a., <i>Cocc., Cycl., Graph., </i>NUX-V., <i>Petr., </i>Phos., Ran-b., <i>Sars., Sep., Spig., Stram., Zinc.</i></p>
<p class="p3">&lt; Approach storm (p. 1403) - <i>Agar., </i>Aur., Caust., Hyper., <i>Kali-bi., Nat-c., </i>Nit-ac., Petr., <i>Phos., </i>PSOR., RHOD., <i>Rhus-t., Sep., </i>Sil.</p>
<p class="p3">&lt; Spring (p. 1403) - Aur., Bar-m., <i>Bell., Calc., </i>Carb-v., <i>Chel., Colch., </i>Dulc., Hep., Kali-bi., Nux-v., <i>Rhus-t., </i>Sars., Sep., Sil.</p>
<p class="p3">Averse fats (p. 480) - <i>Ars., </i>Bell., Calc., <i>Carb-an., </i>Carb-v., CHIN., Chin-a., <i>Colch., Cycl., </i>Bell., <i>Hep., </i>Nat-c., PETR., Phos., Rheum, Rhus-t., <i>Sep.</i></p>
<p class="p3">Averse acids (p. 480) - <i>Bell., Cocc., Ferr., </i>Ign., Nux-v., Ph-ac., SABAD.</p>
<p class="p3">Desire salt (p. 486) - <i>Calc., Calc-p., </i>CARB-V., <i>Caust., </i>Cocc., <i>Con., Nit-ac., </i>PHOS., <i>Plb.</i></p>
<p class="p3">Desire sweets (p. 486) - <i>Am-c., </i>Arg-m., Ars., Bar-c., <i>Calc., Carb-v., </i>CHIN., Chin-a., Kali-ars., <i>Kali-c., </i>Kali-p., <i>Nat-c., </i>Nux-v., Petr., <i>Plb., Rheum., Rhus-t., Sabad., Sep.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>Remarks. </i>The chief remedies running through the case are Ars., Calc., Caust., Nat-c., Nux-v., Phos., Rhus., Sep. Giving the different types their values ; (Capitals = 3 ; Italics = 2 ; Ordinary = 1) ; we find that Ars. appears 8 times to value of 16 = Ars. 8<span class="s3"><sup>16 </sup></span>, Calc. 8<span class="s3"><sup>14</sup></span>, Caust. 7<span class="s3"><sup>13</sup></span>, Nat-c. 6<span class="s3"><sup>9</sup></span>, Nux-v. 6<span class="s3"><sup>9</sup></span>, Phos. 10<span class="s3"><sup>18</sup></span>, Rhus-t. 7<span class="s3"><sup>12</sup></span>, Sep. 6<span class="s3"><sup>11</sup></span>.</p>
<p class="p3">The constitution of the patient suggested either Ars. or Phos.</p>
<p class="p3">We have thus come to these two remedies by only considering the general symptom of the patient.</p>
<p class="p3">The pain in stomach was &gt; hot drinks ; even wine which suits her generally had to be given up owing to its coldness, and as Phos. patients crave cold drinks (even ices) in gastric troubles, we are left with Ars.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Ars-alb. </i>30 - 3 doses at 6-hourly intervals.</p>
<p class="p3">Pain &gt; (which had been present for years) in a few days, and in a few weeks she was almost well, being much less excitable.</p>
<p class="p3">This case shows the importance of Generals in their order - mental, climatic, desires and aversions in food ; all of which must be markedly present to be of any value.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p1"><b>CASE II</b></p>
<p class="p3"><i>     </i>Mrs. W., æ. 58 - <i>Dec. 6th, </i>1910 - Complaining of headaches ever since a girl in her teens ; usually requires to go to bed for at least two days every month (not at period).

<p class="p3"><i>Remarks. </i>Nat-mur. seems to suit the case, not because it is numerically highest alone, but because it corresponds to the type of the patient. Nat-mur. has marked aversion to fats, which this patient desires : but that would not rule out the drug for this reason ; that, though the desires and aversions are general symptoms, they rank much lower in the scale than the mental symptoms. A strong mental symptom like the markedly &lt; consolation would rule out many of lesser importance. Puls. again could never suit this case, no matter how great its numerical value, because of the marked &lt; from consolation. Repertory work is never mechanical, and is only a guide to the study of Materia Medica.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Dec. 9th, </i>1910 - <i>Natrum-mur. </i>200, 3 doses.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Dec. 15th, </i>1910 - A marked aggravation of the headache three days after taking the powders.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>February 14th, </i>1911 - Not had a bad headache since ; no heaviness or caged-in feeling. Bowels began to act naturally soon after the medicine. Hardly any flushes of heat. Much better generally ; got up after influenza and not felt shaky, used to take her weeks to recover. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>February 20th, </i>1911 - Got bad colic due to chill which caused return of headache for one day only. <i>Natrum-mur. </i>200, 3 doses.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>April 7th, </i>1911 - No real headache since last note, slight attempts ; no caged-in feeling. Bowels quite regular. Bearing down with burning and distension entirely gone. No flushes of heat. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>May 16th, </i>1911 - A little vertigo on first lying down : goes off immediately. Headache absent despite severe thunderstorm which formerly caused her to go to bed ; not once the cased-in sensation. Bowels still good.</p>
<p class="p3">Generally a different person in every way ; brighter ; more cheerful ; husband declares her to be a different person to live with. <i>Nat-m. </i>200, 3 doses.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>December 27th, </i>1911 - May have had a slight attempt at headache, but never came to anything ; feels a new creature ; able to do much more work ; very energetic ; general health excellent. <i>Had no medicine since above.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i> </i></p>
<p class="p1"><b>CASE III</b></p>
<p class="p3"><i>     </i>Miss C. æt. 35 - <i>June 13th, </i>1910 - Sleepless since 20 years age ; brought on by excessive musical study ; never taken any sleeping drugs. She lies quite wide awake at night, brain active all the time, especially after lights are out. Often kept awake by persistent tunes ; hardly ever falls asleep for three hours after going to bed ; readily wakened by the least gleam of light : even if drowsy becomes sleepless immediately on getting into bed. Dreams always ; nightmare.</p>
<p class="p3">General health has been good. Throat : painless hoarseness : all colds fly here.</p>
<p class="p3">Stomach : Appetite good. Averse fats, milk. Craves ices, cold food. Emptiness without hunger soon after getting into bed which might prevent sleep. &gt; Eating. Emptiness at 11 a.m.</p>
<p class="p3">M. P. normal.</p>
<p class="p3">Mental : Very excitable to music : irritable ; impatient ; discontented. Fears : in a crowd ; being hemmed in; fire; suffocation. Indifferent to people, especially relatives. Depressed easily.</p>
<p class="p3">Chilly : Hates the cold ; &lt; thunderstorms.</p>
<p class="p3">CHILLY, used as an "eliminating symptom" to cut all the warm remedies, in all the following lists.</p>

<p class="p3"><i>Remarks. </i>The larger rubrics such as sensitive to noise, impatience, etc., are left out as all the competing remedies are in them.</p>
<p class="p3">Phos. not only best indicated, but it has the important peculiar symptoms, - indifference to relations ; all the fears (except fire) ; and the marked craving for ices.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>June 16th, </i>1910 - <i>Phos. </i>10M. 3 doses, 6 hours apart.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>July 4th, </i>1910 - She writes "been sleeping better and have been much quieter mentally at night." <i>No medicine.</i></p>

<p class="p3"><i>     </i>Mr. B. æt. 28 - <i>May 6th, </i>1910 - Pain and distension abdomen for last three years, especially 6 a.m. or 4 p.m. ; felt like bubble inside ; been taking Sod-bicarb. all the time. Distension, not for some time after eating.</p>
<p class="p3">&gt; Escape flatus (offensive) ; &gt; hot drinks. Sleeps well till wakened at 6 a.m. by pain.</p>
<p class="p3">Appetite good ; no special desires or aversions ; some heartburn.</p>
<p class="p3">Rheumatic pains general ; no special modalities.</p>
<p class="p3">Weather conditions do not affect him.</p>
<p class="p3">Mental : &lt; In himself if angry. Neither care nor worry. Quick tempered but controls it. Weak concentration.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Lycop. </i>1M, 4 doses, 6-hourly.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>May 19th, </i>1910 - Not had slightest effect. Gave additional symptoms. Pain especially at 6 a.m. comes in waves or spasms ; has to draw up knees on abdomen, causes him to roll in discomfort.</p>
<p class="p3">&lt; If he gets angry. &gt; Coffee.</p>
<p class="p3">Gets cramp in arms readily when rowing.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Abdomen</i></p>
<p class="p3">Pain &lt; 6 a.m. (Kent, p. 555) - <i>Coloc., </i>Ox-ac.<span class="s4"><br>
</span>&lt; 4 p.m. (p. 555) - Caust., Coloc., Bell., LYC., Mag-m., Phys.<span class="s4"><br>
</span>&lt; anger (p. 556) - <i>Cham., </i>Cocc., <i>Coloc., Nux-v., Staph., Sulph.</i><span class="s4"><br>
</span>&gt; coffee (p. 557) - COLOC.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Coloc. </i>1M, 4 doses, 6-hourly.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>May 27th, </i>1910 - Been practically well last few days. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>June 3rd, </i>1910 - "Nothing wrong with me." <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>June 29th, </i>1910 - Not wakened at 6 a.m. now ; never feels pain at 4 p.m. ; sleeping perfectly ; but some flatulence still about ; no heartburn ; distension hardly present ; rheumatic pains gone. Almost but not quite well. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>Coloc. </i>10M, 4 doses, 6-hourly.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>June 18th, </i>1911 - Mother reports that the medicine upset him somewhat at first, but since then and now is perfectly well : not least trouble.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Remarks. </i>We had here nothing but particulars to work with, but they were so definite ; though not obtained till second visit.</p>
<p class="p3">Lycop. had the 4 p.m. aggravation, also generally &lt; after anger, and the &gt; escape flatus. We thus see the great difficulty of prescribing on particulars. We had Hering's "three legs to our stool," but that was not enough.</p>

<p class="p3"><i>     </i>A. M., (32). <i>Sept. 30th, </i>1911 - (An outpatient case). Headache vertex and eye all his life. Getting much worse. Lasts from three days to three weeks. So severe, hardly knows what to do. Worse sleep. Head very tender, can't bear being touched. Sickness last ten hours, and vomits every ten minutes. Always got a headache. Can't eat, therefore very weak.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Feels well before attack.</i></p>
<p class="p3">Good family history ; also general history good. No better for anything. Burrows head in pillow. Eyes good, tested lately. Tongue indented. Feels as if suffocated after eating, which greatly aggravates the headache.</p>
<p class="p3">Averse : Fats, milk.</p>
<p class="p3">Very sleepy at 8 p.m. Dreams exciting. Alopecia areata.</p>
<p class="p3">&lt; Heat ; thunder ; sleep. Depressed &lt; Consolation. Wants to be alone.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Worse heat </i>is used as an eliminating symptom to cut out all the cold remedies from the following lists.</p>

</span>&lt; Thunder (p. 1403) - Aur., Bry., <i>K-bi., Lach., Lyc., </i>Nat-m., Puls., Sul., Thuj., <i>Tub.</i><span class="s4"><br>
</span>Averse fat (p. 480) - Bry., <i>Merc., Nat-m., </i>PTEL., PULS., <i>Sul.</i><span class="s4"><br>
</span>Averse milk (p. 481) - <i>Bry., Puls., Sul.</i><span class="s4"><br>
</span>Headache &lt; sleep (p. 148) - Arg-n., <i>Aur., Bry., K-bi., </i>LACH., <i>Lyc., </i>Merc., NAT-M., Puls., <i>Sul., Thuj.</i><span class="s4"><br>
</span>= Lach. 2<span class="s3"><sup>5</sup></span>, Lyc. 3<span class="s3"><sup>5</sup></span>, Merc. 3<span class="s3"><sup>4</sup></span>, Nat-m. 4<span class="s3"><sup>9</sup></span>, Puls. 4<span class="s3"><sup>7</sup></span>, Sul. 4<span class="s3"><sup>7</sup></span>, Thuj. 3<span class="s3"><sup>4</sup></span>.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Puls. </i>could never come in, outruled by "&lt; consolation" test, and by look of patient. Leaves <i>Nat-m., </i>and <i>Sul. </i>Aspect typical Nat-mur., <i>Nat-mur. </i>30, 4 doses 6-hourly.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>October 21st </i>- Not been laid up with his headaches for the last three weeks ; and not been sick, but hardly so well in himself. Has had a cold and is heavy and dull. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>November 11th - </i>One attack threatened but passed off. If they came on before, they always laid him up for a week. He feels stronger, brighter, more heart for things. Sleep less heavy ; dreams the same. Hair the same. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>December 7th - </i>Had bilious attack on the 3rd inst., but was not sick ; only headache ; same character. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>January 4th, </i>1912 - Had four attacks since here, two bad. Same character. <i>Bry. </i>30, 6 doses, 3-hourly.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Remarks. </i>It is never wise during an acute exacerbation of a chronic malady to prescribe the chronic remedy, as you are apt to increase needlessly the sufferings of your patient. Under such circumstances one prescribes a more superficial remedy corresponding to the immediate modalties : <i>e.g., </i>Bry. in a Nat-mur. case : Bell. in a Calc-c. case, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>January 11th - </i>Cannot eat ; though headache. <i>Nat-mur. </i>200, 4 doses, 6-hourly.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>February 1st - </i>Not had an attack since here, despite heavy work, feels very well. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>February 22nd - </i>Not had a headache for 2 months. Indigestion immediately p.c. Feels better in himself. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i>March 14th - </i>Only a slight headache since here, but was able to stop at work ; and right again. <i>No medicine.</i></p>

<p class="p3"><i>     </i>Miss R.G., (20). (Outpatient, Hospital). <i>Feb.15th, </i>1912 - Pain, back, when she catches cold. Head, burning pain on vertex : &gt; on closing eyes.

</span><i>Nat-mur. </i>30, 4 doses, 6-hourly.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>March 14th, </i>1912 - Very much better in herself. Hardly had a headache. No burning vertex. Not the least faintish. Pain in back gone. No cough : never been so free of cough since it began years ago. <i>No medicine.</i></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><i>     </i></span>Of course there are heaps of cases, where you cannot get any mental or other general symptoms so definitely marked as in the foregoing, and where your have got to be most careful not to take symptoms too easily for "eliminating" purposes, or to knock out drugs on insufficient cause. If you do, you will find yourself landed with - <i>Sepia </i>probably, most times : though you might very often do worse.</p>
<p class="p4"><i>     Times of day, </i>if very definite, help. Some people are perfectly well all day, but their nights are purgatorial. Some are in pain all day long, but perfectly well at night. Some rise feeling miserably ill and tired <i>after a good night's rest, and with nothing to account for it </i>(it is important to ascertain this !) and only feel pretty well as the day wears on, and are bright and happy and ready for work, mental and physical, in the evening, when you might expect them to be tired. Others have all their weariness and languor, all their sufferings, in the evening - after days neither strenuous nor fatiguing. These are important generals, and very useful in helping to determine the drug. Some drugs have their very hour on the face of the clock : and others a very marked periodicity. The worse-in-evening people, by the way, have a talent for working out at <i>Lycopodium.</i></p>
<p class="p4"><i>     Worse from damp, </i>and <i>worse from dry weather </i>are deep-seated, and very important : if strongly marked in the patient, they may be used as eliminating symptoms. "I feel ten years younger to-day because it is raining ; all my joints are quite loose, and I can move freely" said a patient a few days ago : while others stiffen and ache for a mere passing shower. There is a small important list, <i>patient better in wet weather </i>which is not in Kent's Repertory* - Alum., Ars., ASAR., Bell., Bov. BRY., Carb-an., Carb-v., CAUST., Cham., <i>Fl-ac., </i>HEP., <i>Ip., </i>Laur., Mang., <i>Med., </i>Mez., Mur-ac., <i>Nit-ac., </i>NUX., <i>Plat., </i>Rhod., <i>Saba., </i>Sep., Sil., Spig., <i>Spong., </i>Staph., Sulph., Zinc. (Rheumatic pain better in wet weather, means practically, <i>Caust., Hep., </i>or <i>Nux-v.). </i>Dr. G. Miller says, "in rheumatism where we expect as a rule to have an agg. from weather changes, its absence becomes peculiar ; where the patient is not affected by <i>change </i>of weather, exclude Dulc., Nux-mos., Phos., Ran-b., Rhodo., Rhus., Sil., Tuberc. And where the patient is not affected by <i>wet </i>weather exclude Calc., Merc., Nat-c., Nat-s., Ruta.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><i>     </i>* </span>Dr. Kent points out that this rubric appears in his Repertory as "Dry weather agg." p. 1357, and "<i>Cold dry weather agg." </i>p. 1349.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><i>     </i></span>Then there are patients who never dare to get into a bath, who are obliged to "wash in sections" as one of them expressed it ; since they feel faint, or actually do faint, as soon as the water flows over their skins : while in a lesser degree, others feel miserably weak and ill after a bath. Such symptoms must be very marked and definite to carry great weight or to rule out drugs ; but they help immensely : the last may give the casting vote between <i>Puls. </i>and <i>Sulph.</i></p>
<p class="p4"><i>     </i>Last, and least important of all, comes the name of the patient's malady. Look it up, if you like, at the very end, and it may joyfully confirm your choice of drug, <i>which it must not unduly bias. </i>If your patient is an asthmatic patient, it is comforting to know that the drug his symptoms demand has again and again cured bad cases of asthma. But remedies that have never been recorded as having cured asthma will do the trick, if the symptoms of the patient cry out for them, as their simillimum. Drugs have not all been pushed far enough to produce lesions, and their voices do not carry, as a rule, deeper than function - except in the cases of accidental poisoning. But get the right drug, the stimulus needed, and you will find the reaction of the organism deep enough in all conscience, and long-sustained. Then KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ! Wait long for a second very definite cry, before you dare to interfere. You may have to wait months - then wait ! Remember, it is the patient who has to cure himself ; the drug cannot cure him ; the drug is only the stimulus that starts the vital reaction. So long as curative reaction is in progress, it is senseless - criminal - to interfere. This is the way to crush your work, to vitiate your experience, to break your heart. So long the patient is improving, let him be, and never meddle <i>till he begins to slip back : that </i>is the first possible moment to repeat, or to reconsider the case. It is safer to be a little late than a little soon. You must "go fast slowly," there is no other way.</p>
